    /// data structure which tracks registered breakpoint bytecodes.
    ///
    /// e.g: consider an implementation where `self` (i.e: the Target itself)
    /// has a `commands: HashMap<usize, HashSet<BytecodeId>>` field, and
    /// tries to iterate over it as follows:
    ///
    /// ```compile_fail
    /// for id in self.commands.get(&addr).unwrap() {
    ///     callback(self, *id)?
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// Alas, this will fail to compile, as there's no way to guarantee that the
    /// callback won't attempt to modify `self.commands`. In a less safe
    /// language, this could result have resulted in iterator invalidation.
    ///
    /// So, what's the solution?
    ///
    /// Well, the simplest fix would be to simply clone the field prior to
    /// iterating over it. This works... though it may result in degraded
    /// performance when a breakpoint is being hit in a hot loop.
    ///
    /// Instead, a better approach might be to wrap the data structure in an
    /// `Option`, temporarily taking ownership of the data prior to iterating
    /// over it using [`Option::take`].
    ///
    /// The code would look something like this:
    ///
    /// ```ignored
    /// let cmds = self.commands.take().unwrap();
    /// let mut res = Ok(());
    /// for id in self.commands.get(&addr).unwrap() {
    ///     res = callback(self, *id)
    ///     if res.is_err() {
    ///         break;
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// self.commands = Some(cmds); // don't forget!
    /// res
    /// ```
    ///
    /// While this approach is certainly more unwieldy that calling `.clone()` -
    /// requiring other methods to use something like `.as_mut().unwrap()` to
    /// access the field - using `Option::take` is significantly faster than
    /// calling `.clone()`, and guarantees a constant runtime + no unnecessary
    /// heap-allocations.
    ///
    /// Protip: if the data structure is relatively heavy to memcpy (e.g: using
    /// a fixed-length array), wrapping the field in a `Box<...>` (or `&mut ...`
    /// on `no_std`) makes `Option::take` significantly cheaper.
    ///
    /// ## Caveats with `Option::take`
    ///
    /// Unfortunately, this workaround is more of a "hack" than an elegant
    /// solution, and doesn't have the same strong correctness guarantees as the
    /// `.clone()` method.
    ///
    /// For example, while `gdbstub` never actually calls any methods that
    /// modify the breakpoint list as part of the `callback` method, the
    /// compiler doesn't actually enforce that fact, and an errant
    /// implementation in `gdbstub` could break that invariant, resulting in a
    /// panic when calling `.as_mut().unwrap()` elsewhere in the code.

    /// lifetime from the target lifetime.
